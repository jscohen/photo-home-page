To create the database for use, run photos.sql in the scripts folder.

This site showcases photos I took while I lived in China and offers a basic e-commerce system connected to a database to "buy" them.

To view the photos, simply go to the photo page and click on the photo for a closer view, using the lytebox plug-in.

On the homepage, the photos work as a slideshow, changing photo every 15 seconds.

To access the photos, go to the photos page and select your region.  Then you can view the photos using the lytebox viewer.

To use the ecommerce system, you must be logged in so sign up or make an account.  There is client side and server side validation on the signup system as well as a CAPTCHA.

To add a photo to the cart, click on the add to cart button.  When viewing the cart, you can remove individual photos or clear the shopping cart.  To continue, go to the checkout page and fill out the form.

Once the form is submitted you will see a confirm page thanking you for using the site.
