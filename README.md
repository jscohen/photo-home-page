To create the database for use, run photos.sql in the scripts folder.

This site showcases photos I took while I lived in China and offers a basic e-commerce system connected to a database to "buy" them.

To view the photos, simply go to the photo page and click on the photo for a closer view, using the lytebox plug-in.

On the homepage, the photos work as a slideshow, changing photo every 15 seconds.
